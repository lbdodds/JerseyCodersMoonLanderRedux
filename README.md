# Jersey Coders Moon Lander Redux

This is the [Moon Lander Game](http://www.gametutorial.net/article/Keyboard-input---Moon-lander) from Game Tutorial, built upon their Java Framework.

The game is a simple landing game where the aim is to land your rocket onto a landing pad below a certain speed threshold to avoid crashing.

## What to do

Moving forwards, the plan is to alter the game to introduce new elements to gameplay or even completely alter the gameplay completely.
